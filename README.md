# Python Arcade's new 3.0.0.dev26 Camera Split Screen Example

A simple example that demonstrates using multiple cameras to allow a split 
screen using the new camera in Arcade 3.0.

The left screen follows the player, while the right screen is stationary. The 
code is written in a way that it could easily be extended to two players, or
to more than two players.

**WARNING: This example currently uses a development build of arcade 3.0.0.
dev26.
At this time the new camera code is still in development, so this example might
be out of date with later 3.0.0 versions of arcade. I'll try and update it, but
I make no guarantees.**
